                  <h2>Private Tutoring</h2>
                  <p>On occassion, I offer private tutoring to college and university students in various mathematics and statisics courses. I have included common course descriptions below to aid in your selection. Course numbers are included for common lower-division courses. Not all courses are taught uniformly, but the descriptions are a good indicator of the common topics shown in such a course. If a course is not listed, please send a message with a detailed description of the course and I can do my best to assist. My email address can be found on the right sidebar.</p>
                  <p><b>Please, no finance, accounting, and economics courses. Those courses are not strictly mathematics. Please, no requests for high school students.</b></p>

                  <p>Need to hear what others have said about me?</p>

                  <p><i>â€œSean [is] the best tutor I have ever had! He took me from a failing grade in statistics to a low A! He even provided amazing resources to get me started in calculus! As someone who has a weakness in applying math, Sean's explanations made the most sense. 
                  I highly recommend him! Such quality and at an affordable price."</i>

                  <p><i>"Throughout my college career, I have struggled with math so much that I failed Calculus 3 twice and had to drop Differential Equations.
                    I started falling behind and struggled until I began tutoring with Mr. Roberson.
                    He helped me learn and understand these fundamental concepts and provided new insights into these courses.
                    Together he helped me get back on track, and I was able to pass all my math-related courses
                    (Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations) because of his tutoring.
                    Mr. Roberson was easy to reach, patient, and very flexible when it came to scheduling.
                    ... Overall Mr. Roberson is one of the best tutors out there and I wouldn't be where I am today without him, 10 out of 10."</i>
