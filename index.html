					<p>I'm Sean Zachary Roberson, a mathematician and operations research analyst.</p>
          <p>Most of my work has been in educational settings - in particular, I have taught high school and community college courses and served as teaching assistant for calculus II at UT San Antonio (see <a href="#Projects">Projects</a> for more information).
          I still remain active within the UTSA community, supporting events put on by the department of mathematics and the ACM UTSA chapter.</p>
          <p>Currently I serve as an Operations Research Analyst for the Air Education Training Command at Randolph AFB, TX.</p>

                <p>While at the University of Texas at San Antonio, I served as a teaching assistant for MAT 1224 (now MAT 1223), Calculus II. I created a series of videos to help students understand the material. The videos can be found 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrwdQBztFSUZKSWWA0BkaB7w6vMoQvFAs">here</a>. All material is based on the 
                <a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-2">OpenStax Calculus, Volume 2 text.</a><br></p>

                <p>Also included here is a <a href='Series_Flowcharts.pdf'>flowchart</a> on how to think about the convergence of series.</p>

                <p>A <a href="Exam3Guide.pdf">study guide</a> for the third exam in the course is also available, along with its 
                <a href="Exam3Guide_Solutions.pdf">solutions.</a></p>

                <strong>Photoacoustic Sensing</strong><br/>
                As part of an internship project in the fall of 2023, I worked with Drs. Randolph Glickman and Saher Maswadi to examine the use of photoacoustic sensing in the detection of defects in a known material. The project combined elements of signal processing, laser physics, and materials science. The project report can be read 
                <a href="Projects/PASensing.pdf">here</a>.<br>

                <strong>Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms</strong><br/>
                Project paper written for an independent study course on vector calculus at Texas A&M University - San Antonio. The aim was to examine the applications of differential forms in electromagnetism - in particular, the condensation of Maxwell's equations from 4 to 2. Read the paper 
                <a href="Projects/VectorCalculus.pdf">here</a>.<br>

                <strong>Bounds on the Traveling Salesman Problem</strong><br/>
                Project paper on the Traveling Salesman Problem, written for a course in graph theory at Texas A&M University. Read the paper 
                <a href="Projects/SeanRoberson_TSP.pdf">here</a>.<br>

                <strong>Gaussian Integers</strong><br/>
                Project paper on Gaussian integers, written for an undergraduate course in abstract algebra at Texas A&M University - San Antonio. Read the paper 
                <a href="Projects/GaussianIntegers.pdf">here</a>.<br>

                <strong>Stochastic Calculus</strong><br/>
                As part of an independent study course at Texas A&M, I began reading on the foundations of stochastic calculus. I then presented an introductory talk on the topic at a talk for the graduate student organization in the math department. See the presentation 
                <a href="Projects/StochasticCalculus_SZR.pdf">here.</a><br/>

                <strong>Euler-Maruyama Method</strong><br/>
                As part of a project for a course in an introduction to applied mathematics, I presented on the Euler-Maruyama method, a numerical method to solve stochastic differential equations. The project paper can be read 
                <a href="Projects/SZR_EM.pdf">here,</a> and a video presentation based on this paper can be watched 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/ePDInJYg714">here.</a> The 
                <a href="Project/EM_Presentation.pdf">slides</a> can be viewed as well.<br/>

                <strong>A Mathematician's Guide to Machine Learning</strong><br/>
                An introductory talk about machine learning, focusing on the mathematical framework. A short version of the talk was given at a DevSA event, whose slides are 
                <a href="Projects/IntroML_DevSA.pdf">here.</a><br>
                For RowdyHacks X, a slightly expanded version of the talk is available at <a href="Projects/IntroML_RowdyHacks.pdf">here,</a>
                with a code notebook available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/seanroberson/rhx-mlintro">Kaggle,</a>
                and the actual Jupyter notebook is available for download <a href = "Projects/IntroML_RH.ipynb">here.</a><br/>

                <strong>Traffic Flow</strong><br/>
                A project for the UTSA course MAT 5673, Partial Differential Equations I. The project was to model traffic flow using the one-dimensional transport equation. The presentation, whose slides are 
                <a href="Projects/TrafficFlow.pdf">here,</a> culminated in the creation of a solver using the Godunov method to solve nonlinear transport equations. Joint work with C. Ayo, E. Jones, and B. Morgan.<br>
